# Batch Tetris

For some years ago i made the Tetris game in batch. I dont remember much of how its made, but i remember it was one of the first big projects i made with programing. So here it is, a complete version of Tetris, with the special endings, score boards, both type a and b and costumization of everything. It does look very stretched out in windows 10, thats because microsoft changed the font of CMD for some years ago. Here are some images of how the game looks:

As i said i made this years ago, so dont complain if something is not working or anything like that, for i will not fix it, this is purely here for legacy reasons.

Anyhow, hope you enjoy it!
